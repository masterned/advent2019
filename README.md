# Advent 2019 Calendar
## Information
> For the Christmas season, I am working through a coding puzzle advent calendar provided by https://adventofcode.com.
> In order to back-up my code, I will be storing a git repo on GitHub, but I'm hoping to avoid collaberation as much as possible.
> Feel free to comment on my code *(I am working through this in order to improve my programming skills afterall)*.
> I will be pushing my code each time I solve a puzzle (this may be subject to change).
